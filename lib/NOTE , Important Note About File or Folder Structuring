//Note
Please import each file in main.dart file one by one,
open Each File and See their Class name and import them one by one in main.dart file,
you can't add all files in main.dart file at time




Second Important Note About :
File OR Folder Structuring <> This is so important for Structuring Files 

Like All Pages/Screens/View.dart files > will be in screen/view/pages Folder in lib folder like this:
       (   home_screen.dart       in this folder   <screens> in lib folder  )

Logic will be in separate Folder like Fuctions folder you create in lib folder
     (    addtolistfunction.dart  in              <functions> in lib folder


custom widgets you have crated for you easiness will be in widgets folder in this we use custom_button  for over project

(  custom_button.dart            in this folder   <widgets folder> in lib folder


This is the best approach file structuring
